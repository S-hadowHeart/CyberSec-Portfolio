# CIA
- _Confidentiality , Integrity , Availability_
- Before we can decribe something as secure , we need to consider better what makes up security.
- when you want to judege the security of system , you need to think in terms of security triad:
- Confidentialiy , integrity, and availbility (CIA)
  - __Confidentiality__ ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
  - __Integrity__ aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
  - __Availability__ aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.
- __Confidentiality :__
  - during online shopping , you expect your credit card number to be disclosed only to the entity that processes the payment.
  - if you doubt that your credit card information will be disclosed to an untrusted party,you will most likely refrain from continuing with transcation.
  - Moreover , if a data breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable information, including credit cards, the company will incur huge losses on multiple levels.
 
  - According to various laws in modern countries, healthcare providers must ensure and maintain the confidentiality of medical records.
  - Consequently , healthcare providers can be held legally accountable if they illegally disclose their patients' medical records
- __Integrity :__
  - after filing out your order , if an intruder can alter the shipping address you have submitted ,
  - the package will be sent to someone else.
  - wihtout data integrity , you might be very reluctant to place your order with this seller.
 
  - if patient record is accidentally or maliciously altered, it can lead to the wrong treatment being administered,
  - which, in turn, can lead to a life-threatening situation.
  - Hence, the system would be useless and potentially harmful without ensuring the integrity of medical records.
- __Availablity :__
  - To place your online order , you will either browse the store's website or use its official app.
  - if the service is unavailable , you  won't be able to browse the products or place an order if you continue to face such technical issues,
  - you might eventually give up and start looking for different online store.
 
  - when patient visits a clinic to follow up on their medical  condition , the system must be available.
  - An unvaliable system would mean that the medical practitioner cannot access the patient's records
  - And consequently won't know if any current symptoms are related to the patient's medical history.
  - This situation can make the medical diagnosis more challenging and error-prone.
 
- __Authenticity :__
  - Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit.
  - Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
- __Nonerepudiation :__
  - Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something.
  - Nonrepudiation ensures that original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data.
  - This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping , patient diagnosis and banking.
These two requirements are closely related. The need to tell authentic files or order s from fake ones is indispensable.
Moreover, ensuring that the other party cannot deny being the source is vital for many systems to be usable.

- __Utility :__
  - Utility focuses on the uefulness of the information.
  - For instance, a use might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage.
  - Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them.
  - in other words , although still available the information is in form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility
 
- __Possession :__
  - THis security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking , copying or controlling.
  - For instance , an adversary might take backup drive , meaning we loss possession of the information as long as they have the drive.
  - Alternatively, the adversary might succeed in encrypting our data using randomware; this also leads to the loss of possession of the data.


## DAD [Disclosure , Alteration , Destruction/Denial]
- The security of system is attacked through one of several means.
- it can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data , or destruction of data.

- __Disclosure :__
  - is the opposite of confidentiality.
  - disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- __Alteration :__
  - is the opposite of integrity.
  - Example : the integrity of a cheque is indispensable
 
- __Destruction/Denial:__
  - is the opposite of Availability
