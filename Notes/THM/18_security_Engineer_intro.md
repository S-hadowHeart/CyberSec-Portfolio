## What is a security Engineer?
- As the internet age transforms how organization work worldwide, it also brings challenges.
- whilethere is no doubt that technology has made the life of organizations a lot easier by opening new avenues of collaboration and innovation,we often hear about organizations getting hacked,losing customer data , getting ransomed , and facing other types of cyber attacks.
- in reponding to these threats , organizations can either go back to the old ways of doing business without getting any aid from modern technology, pubtting them at disadvantage,or they can move forward and ensure the security of the digital side of their business.
- Hence, just like any organization will protect its physical assets and dedicate whole departments to them, a company's digital assets must also be secured.
- it must be noted here that organizations do all of this to ensure their primary goal is achieved without hindrance.

### The Role os a Security Engineer
- Keeping in view the above-mentioned need for security, organizations hire security engineers.
- in order to hire a security engineer,an organization perceives a security engineer as someone who:
  - Owns the overall security of an organization.The main person responsible for securing an organization's digital assets.
  - Ensures that the organization's cyber security risk is minimized at all times.
  - Devises strategies and crates systems that minimize the risk posed by cyber security threats to an organization.
  - periodically conducts tests to ensure the robustness of the cyber securrity posture of an organization, identifies weak points, and prepares mitigations.
  - Develops and implements secure network solutions.
  - Architects and engineers trustworthy, reliable , and secure systems.~
  - Collaborates and coordinates with other teams to establish security protocols across the organization.

### Qualifications Required for security Engineer
- As you might have noticed the security engineer role mentioned above is very broad and might require a whole department insted of a single person.
- This is cuz this role is defined loosely and varies from organization to organization.
- An engineer takes large problems, breaks them down into smaller chunks , and then solves them.
- Therefore a security engineer is someone that follows this process for security problems.
- meanging that even though you might have a job descriptioni, each day might be quite different since you are faced with various problems.
- overall when hiring security engineer organizations look for the following basic requirements:
  - 0-2 years of experience with IT administration,helpdesk, networks or security operations.~
  - Basic understanding of computer networks, operating systems, and programming
  - Baisc understanding of security concepts such as Governance,Risk and compliance (GRC).

## Core Responsibilities of a security Engineer :
- in the previous task, we will expand on the general expectations that an organization has from a security engineer in order to help them achieve their goals in this role.
- Although loosely defined , a security engineer will often be responsible for the area that follow.
### Asset Management/Asset inventory
- one of the primary steps in ensuring an organization's security is to maintain an organization's asset inventory.
- in terms of cyber security, this will mean managing and maintaining an inventory of an organization's digital assets.
- Security engineers can only own an organization's security if they know what assets the organizations has.
- They must also ensure that this asset inventory is regularly maintained and updated and includes all the required information about assets such as asset name, type, IP addresses, physical location, place in the netowork, applications running on an asset , access permissions(only within the organization or public-facing), and asset owner details.
### Security Policies
- An organization needs robust security policies to maintain a sound securtiy posture.
- A security engineer helps the organization create security policies based on established security principles.
- These policies are then implemented organization-wide,and the security engineer ensures that the implementtaion follows the letter and spirit of the policies.
- Sometimes, a need arises for granting exceptions to the security policies due to business needs.
- in such scenarios, the security enginner consults the security principles to allow or deny exceptions and suggest mitigating steps to minimize risks.
### Secure by Design
- A security engineer ensures that the organization is secure by desgin.
- The engineer understands that the security posture receives the most return on investment(ROI)
- if it follows a secure-by-design philosophy.
- This means that the security engineer takes steps to implement a secure Network architecture,
- ensures the organization's windows, Linux, and Active Directory are hardened , and software development follows the secure software Development Lifecycle.
### Security  Assessment and Assurance
- While securely designing the organization's network and infrastructure might be an excellent first step, a security engineer understands that their job is far from done after that.
- They understatnd that security is hard work that requires just one loophole to be successful.
- To mitigate risks from a continuously evolving threat landscape, a security engineer plans to conduct regular security assessments, audits, and red-teaming and purple-teaming exercises to continuously improve the security posture.
- while securtiy engineers might not be performing assessemts and audits themselves, they are primarily involved in helping schedule these activites, creating request for quotations(RFQs) for eternal parties to perform these activities, and helping prioritize and implement the findings from them.
## Continuous Improvement
- An organization's security is not a one-time job but a continuous effort.
- Similarly, the security engineer's job doesn't end once policies are designed and implemented.
- Rather,it is a journey towards continuous improvement.
- The following steps help security enginner carry out this role.
### Ensuring Awareness
- A security engineer might be tasked with maintaining a certain security awareness  level in the organization.
- Humans are the buiding blocks of any organization, and as is often said, humans are the weakest link in an organization's security.
- A security engineer periodically runs awareness sessions targeting primarily social engineering attacks to ensure that humans don't make mistakes that can compromise an organization's security.
- Awareness sessions are also organized for specific teams to ensure they follow security priniciples related to theire area of experise, like secure software development or secure network architecture.
### Managing Risks in Security
1. Executive Viewpoint
  - Management focuses on minimizing risks when it comes to security.
  - Security is critical as ignoring it can cause:
      - Operational disruptions
      - Data leakage
      - Lawsuits
      - Other business risks
2. Role of Security Engineer
  - Identify security risks.
  - Determine likelihood and impact.
  - Suggest solutions to minimize risks.
  - Act as a trusted advisor to management.
3. Risk Reality
  - Eliminating all risks is not always possible.
  - Sometimes risks must be:
    - Accepted (live with it)
    - Mitigated (reduce impact/likelihood)
4. Business Decision
  - Accepting or mitigating risks is ultimately a business decision.
  - Security engineer provides expertise to guide decision-making.
5. Example Scenario
  - Organization uses supply chain software that runs on a vulnerable Linux version.
  - Updating to a safe OS version requires:
    - More than a year of effort
    - Vendor engagement (vendor hasn’t tested software on latest OS)
  - Deploying on new OS without testing risks operational problems.
6. Resulting Risk
  - Vulnerable OS introduces a security risk.
7. Mitigation Approach Suggested by Security Engineer
  - Harden the OS with additional security controls.
  - Place a reverse proxy in front of the system to avoid direct internet exposure.
8. Outcome
  - Risk is reduced significantly.
  - Operations remain unaffected.
  - Risk not eliminated but made manageable.

## Change Management
