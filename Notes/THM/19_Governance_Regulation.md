# Information Security Frameworks – Pointwise Notes

## 1. **Definition**
- An **information security framework** is a structured set of guidelines and documents that direct how an organisation manages, implements, and enforces security practices.

## 2. **Types of Governance Documents**
- **Policy:** States organisational goals, principles, and broad guidelines for security objectives.
- **Standard:** Specifies strict requirements and specifications for processes, products, or services.
- **Guideline:** Offers recommended practices, not mandatory, for supporting security efforts.
- **Procedure:** Provides step-by-step instructions for completing specific security-related tasks.
- **Baseline:** Establishes minimum security requirements for systems or operations.

## 3. **Steps to Develop Governance Documents**
1. **Identify Scope & Purpose:** Determine what is needed and why.
2. **Research & Review:** Study laws, standards, and internal documentation.
3. **Draft the Document:** Outline and write clear, actionable content aligned to organisation goals.
4. **Review & Approval:** Gather feedback, especially from stakeholders and legal, and formally approve.
5. **Implementation & Communication:** Publish, train staff, and clarify responsibilities.
6. **Periodic Review & Update:** Monitor compliance and update per evolving threats or regulations.

## 4. **Sample Scenarios**
- **Password Policy:**
  - Specifies password length, complexity, expiration, change/reset procedures, communication, training, and compliance monitoring.
- **Incident Response Procedure:**
  - Defines incident types, assigns roles, details response steps (containment, investigation, recovery), reporting methods, and improvement cycle.

## 5. **Use of External Frameworks**
