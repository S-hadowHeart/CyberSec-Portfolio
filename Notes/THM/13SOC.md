# SOC (Security Operations Center)
- is dedicated facility operated by specialized security team.
- This team aims to continuously monitor an organization's network and resources and identify suspicious activity to prevent damage.
- This team works 24 hours a day , seven days a week

## Purpose and Components
- The main Focus of team is to keep Detection and Response intact.
- Tthe team has some resources avaliable in the form of security solutions that help them achieve this
- These solutionos integrate the whole company's network and all the system to monitor them from one centralized loaction.
- Continuous monitoring is required to detect and respond to any security incident.

## Detection
- __Detect vulnerabilities:__
  - A vulnerability is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level.
  - A vulnerabllity might be discovered in any device's software (operating system and programs), such as server or computer.
  - For instance, the SOC might discover a set of MS Windows computers that must be patched against a specific publisged vulnerability.
  - Strictly speaking , vulnerabilities are not necessarily the SOC's responsibility; however , unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of entire company.

- __Detect unauthorized activity:__
  - Consider the case where an attaacker discovered the username and password of one of the employees and used them to log in to the company system.
  - it is crucial to detect this kind of unauthorized activity quickly befoer it causes any damage.
  - Many clues , such as geographix location , can help us detect this.

- __Detect policy violations:__
  - A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance.
  - what is considered a violation would vary from company to company;;;
  - example include downloading pirated media files and sending confidential company files insecurely.
 
- __Detect intrusions:__
  - intrusions refer to unauthorized access to system and networks.
  - One scenario would be an attacker successfully exploiting our web application.
  - Another would be a user visiting a malicious site and getting their computer infected.

## Response
- __support with incident response:__
- once an incident is detected , certain steps are taken to response includes minimizing its impact and performing the root cause analysis of the incident.
- The SOC team also helps the incident response team carry out these steps.

- There are three pillars of a SOC
- with all these pillars , a SOC team becomes mature and efficiently detects and responds to differentt incidents.
- These pillars are People , Process and Technology.

- __People, Process and Technology__ coxist in a SOC environment.
- A team of professional individulas working on state-of-the-art security tools in the presence of proper processes
- is what makes a mature SOC environment.
