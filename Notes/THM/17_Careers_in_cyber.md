## Introduction
- Cyber security careers are becoming more in demadnd and offer high salaries.
- There are many diffrent jobs within the securtiy industry, from offensive pentesting(hacking machinces and reporting on vulnerabilities) to deensive security (defending against and invesigating cyberattacks).

### Security Analyst
- Security analysts are integral to consturcting security measures across organisations to protect the company from attacks.
- Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures.
- This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

#### Responsiblities
- Working with various stakeholders to analysse  the cyber security throughout the company.
- Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks , documenting security issues and measures taken in response.
- Develop Security plans , incorporating research on new attack tools and rends , and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

### Security Engineer
 - security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data-often sourced from members of the security workforce.
 - Security engineers work acrross circumventing a breadth of attacks,including web application attacks, network threats , and evolving trends and tactics.
 - The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt securtiy measures to mitigate the risk of attacks and data loss.

#### Responsibilities 
  -  Testing and Scrreening security measures acrosss software
  -  Monitor networks and resports to update systems and mitigtate vulnerabilities.
  -  Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

### Incident Responder 
  - Incident responders respond productivity  and efficiently to security breaches.
  - Responsibilities include creating plans , policies , and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents.
  - This is often a highly pressurised postion with assessments and responses required in real-time , as attacks are unfolding.
  - incident response metrics include MTTd , MTTA, and MTTR-the meantime to detect, acknowledge , and recover (from attacks.)
  - The aim to achieve a swift and effective response , retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications.
  - Ultimately , incident responders protect the company's data , resputation , and finicial from cyber attacks.

#### Responsibilities
- Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
- Maintaining strong securtiy best practices and supporting inccident response measures.
- Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks , condidering learnings and adaptions to take from incidents.

### Digital Forensics Examiner 
- you  would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help  solve crimes:
- charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent.
- On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network,
- you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents,such as poliy violations.

#### Responsibilties
- Collect digital  evidence while observing legal procedures
- Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
- Document your findings and report on the case

### Malware Analyst
- A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings.
- A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usally in a low-level language.
- This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background,especially in low-level language such as assembly language and C language.
- The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

#### Responsibilities
- carry out static analysis of malicious programs , which entails reverse-engineering
  - Static analysis: The process of analyzing malware without executing it , but in a controlled environment.
- Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
  - Dynamic analysis: The process of analyzing malware by running it in a controlled environment like a sandbox
- Document and report all the findings
