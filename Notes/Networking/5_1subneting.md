# Subnetting Category 1
 - finding network and broadcast address 
   - just all 0 after subnetthing in host id then it will network subnet id (__SID__)
   - all 1 after subnetthing in host id then it will Direct broadcast address (__DBA__)

## AD Rule
- calculate 1st then just add total to find next SID and DBA (for same size of network)
- full network id and 1st SID will same
- last subnet DBA and and last ip of netowrk will same
- so what they actually they represent ?
